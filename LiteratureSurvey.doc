Basically, concrete is a mixture of an aggregate (usually sand and small pieces of stone)
bound together by cement. A variety of stones, such as crushed marble, granite chips, and gravel,
can be used, each giving a different effect of colour and texture. Commercial cement is gray, white,
or black; but it can be coloured by additives. The cement most widely used by sculptors is ciment fondu
, which is extremely hard and quick setting. A recent invention—at least, in appropriate forms for 
sculpture—concrete is rapidly replacing stone for certain types of work. Because it is cheap, hard,
tough, and durable, it is particularly suitable for large outdoor projects, especially decorative wall surfaces.
With proper reinforcement it permits great freedom of design. And by using techniques similar to those of the building industry,
sculptors are able to create works in concrete on a gigantic scale.
